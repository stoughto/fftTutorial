fftTutorial
===========

Python scripts and documents demonstrating FFT, power spectra, and
cross spectra.
NFFTFSdemo.py does not require any inputs. Simply run the program. 
It generates a graph of 4 sine curves and the result of 4 ffts. The 4 
graphs are supposed to demonstrate how changing the NFFT
and FS affects the psd function
